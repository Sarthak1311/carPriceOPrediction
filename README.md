# the first pahse --->  Car Damage Detection & Scoring System

This project uses **YOLOv8** and **Streamlit** to detect car damages such as scratches, dents, and paint damage.  
It then calculates a **Car Quality Score (0â€“100)** based on the severity and number of damages.  
This score can be further used for **car price prediction** or insurance-related applications.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Detects **Scratches**, **Dents**, and **Paint Damage** on cars.
- Generates a **Car Quality Score** (higher = better condition).
- Supports **both Images & Videos**.
- **Streamlit UI** for easy interaction.
- Can be integrated with **car price prediction models**.

---
## Usage
1. Run Streamlit App
   - streamlit run app.py
2. Upload Car Image/Video
```
  Upload an image (.jpg, .png) or video (.mp4, .avi).
  The app will:
  Detect damages
  Annotate the car with bounding boxes
  Display the Car Score (/100)
```
ðŸ“Š **Scoring Logic**
  - Each type of damage is given a severity weight:
  - Scratch â†’ 1
  - Paint Damage â†’ 2
  - Dent â†’ 3
### The score calculation considers:
  - Number of damages
  - Bounding box size relative to car
  - Model confidence
  - Finally, the Car Quality Score is:
  - Score = 100 - Normalized_Damage_Value
    ```
    So:
    100 = No Damage (Perfect Condition)
    0 = Severe Damage (Worst Condition)
    ```
### Example Output
1. Image Example:
  - Input: Car with multiple dents
  - Output:
    - Annotated Image with boxes
    - Car Score: 62/100
2. Video Example:
  - Real-time damage detection on uploaded car videos
  - Frame-by-frame scoring


 ***Tech Stack***
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) â€“ Damage detection
- Streamlit â€“ Web UI
- OpenCV & Pillow â€“ Image/Video handling
- Python â€“ Backend logic

  
## Future Improvements 
- Integrate with Car Price Prediction Model.
- Improve scoring with damage severity classification.
- Add insurance claim estimation.
- Train on larger & more diverse dataset.
